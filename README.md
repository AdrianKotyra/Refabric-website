##  Project Overview

Continuing my studies at SVQ Level 6 in Web and Software Development at Edinburgh College's Sighthill campus, I took on a new challenge that allowed me to further enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also incorporating Bootstrap and advanced JavaScript techniques. This project, a group effort, provided a collaborative environment in which I played a pivotal role as the developer, creating everything from scratch myself.

In addition to building on my foundational knowledge, I enrolled in several Udemy courses focused on JavaScript. These courses deepened my understanding of JavaScript, covering more sophisticated concepts and functionalities that I was eager to implement in our project.

Bootstrap became an essential tool in my development toolkit. Its responsive design components and grid system enabled me to create a polished, professional-looking website more efficiently. Utilizing Bootstrap's extensive library of pre-designed elements helped streamline the development process, allowing me to focus on customizing and enhancing the site's unique features.

My role in this group project involved crafting the entire website from the ground up. I meticulously structured the HTML to ensure semantic and accessible content, styled the site with CSS for a cohesive and visually appealing design, and implemented Bootstrap to enhance responsiveness and usability. Advanced JavaScript knowledge gained from my Udemy courses was applied to develop interactive features, such as dynamic content updates, form validations, and engaging user interfaces.

Working on this project was an incredible learning experience that allowed me to integrate new tools and techniques into my web development repertoire. It solidified my ability to create comprehensive, functional, and aesthetically pleasing websites while working within a team setting. This hands-on practice not only advanced my technical skills but also prepared me for future collaborative projects in the field of web development.
